# Rock, Paper and Scissor

The answer to the [second consolidation challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/2/3/challenge) of 100 Days of SwiftUI:
- Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
- Each turn the app will alternate between prompting the player to win or lose.
- The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.
- If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point.
- The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown.

Except for the requirement listed above, I also polish the answer with count down timer and a few animations, this is how the game works:
